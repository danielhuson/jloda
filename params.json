{"name":"JLODA","tagline":"JLODA - Java library of data structures and algorithms","body":"### Welcome to the JLODA project\r\nJLODA is a Java library of data structures and algorithms. This library contains a number of packages that are shared by a number of Java programs. such as SplitsTree, Dendroscope and MEGAN. \r\n### Graphs\r\nJLODA provides a graph package that is very loosely based on the graph class provided by the LEDA C++ library\r\n\r\n### GUI support\r\nThere are a number of supporting classes for the GUIs provided by programs.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMost of the code was written by Daniel Huson (@danielhuson) as part of his research as Professor of Algorithms in Bioinformatics at the University of Tuebingen, starting 2002.\r\n\r\n### Programs that are based on JLODA\r\n* MEGAN\r\n* Dendroscope\r\n* SplitsTree4\r\n* MALT\r\n* MetaSim\r\n* CGViz\r\n","google":"UA-65290057-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
